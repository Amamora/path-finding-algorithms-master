# Description
* Path finding algorithms implementation using **p5.js**
* Official **p5.js** website: https://p5js.org/

# Prerequisites
Ensure you have met the following requirements:
* You have a modern web browser that can render `HTML5 canvas`.
* You have installed **p5.js** libraries.
* You have installed `npm` package manager or `python 3.x` on your machine.
# Installing the project
* **Clone** or **download as ZIP** this repository.
* Open repository folder.
* If you use `npm`, follow these steps:
    * Install `http-server` module globally on your machine via this command:  
    ```
    npm install http-server -g
    ```
    * Run the module:  
    ```
     http-server ./ -p 5500
    ```
    * Open <a>http://localhost:5500/</a> in a web browser.

# Using Path Finding 
* **Left** mouse click will add objects.
* **Right** mouse click will remove objects.
* You can select your algorithm from top left corner.
* When you are ready, click to `start` button.
# Features
* Current algorithms:
    * A*
    * Dijkstra
    * Breadth-first Search
* For **A*** algorithm, you can choose different *heuristic* approaches:
    * Manhattan
    * Euclidean
* You can generate mazes. Maze generation algorithm:
    * Recursive backtracking(DFS)
